```
export FLASK_APP=skf/app.py
export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
export SKF_JWT_SECRET='True'
coverage run tests/run.py test

END 2 END TESTING SELENIUM<br>

Testing SKF App End to End with Selenium<br>
We need to start the SKF API first<br>
Go to the SKF root dir and run:
```
export FLASK_APP=skf/app.py
export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
export SKF_JWT_SECRET='True'
python3 skf/app.py

Now we need to start the SKF Angular<br>
Go to the Angular dir in the SKF root dir and run:

First we need to download the ChromeDriver for our OS<br>
Always pick the last version available:<br>
http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads<br>
Then download your OS driver:<br>
https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=73.0.3683.20/<br>
Unzip it and place it in a good location<br>
Now add it to the Path (Windows):<br>
```
set PATH=%PATH%;C:\WHERE_I_PUT_THEDRIVER
```
Or for Mac/Linux add it to the Path:<br>
```
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin/WHERE_I_PUT_THEDRIVER
```
Go to the SKF root dir and run:
```
export FLASK_APP=skf/app.py
export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
python3 tests/selenium/run.py
```

##Description:

The code performs a comparison between two entities, but the comparison examines the wrong factors or characteristics of the entities, which can lead to incorrect results and resultant weaknesses.

This can lead to incorrect results and resultant weaknesses. For example, the code might inadvertently compare references to objects, instead of the relevant contents of those objects, causing two equal objects to be considered unequal.

##Mitigation:


PHASE:Testing:
Thoroughly test the comparison scheme before deploying code into production. Perform positive testing as well as negative testing.

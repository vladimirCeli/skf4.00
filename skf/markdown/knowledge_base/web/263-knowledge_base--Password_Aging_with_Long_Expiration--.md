##Description:

Allowing password aging to occur unchecked can result in the possibility of diminished password integrity.

Just as neglecting to include functionality for the management of password aging is dangerous, so is allowing password aging to continue unchecked. Passwords must be given a maximum life span, after which a user is required to update with a new and different password.

##Mitigation:


PHASE:Architecture and Design:
Ensure that password aging is limited so that there is a defined maximum age for passwords and so that the user is notified several times leading up to the password expiration.

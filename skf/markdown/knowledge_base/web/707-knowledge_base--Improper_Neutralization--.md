##Description:

The product does not ensure or incorrectly ensures that structured messages or data are well-formed and that certain security properties at met before being read from an upstream component or sent to a downstream component.

If a message is malformed it may cause the message to be incorrectly interpreted. Neutralization is a general term that can refer to one or more of the following: filtering, canonicalization, encoding/decoding, escaping/unescaping, quoting/unquoting, or validation. It describes a process that is independent of the specific protection mechanism that performs the neutralization. This weakness typically applies in cases where the product prepares a control message that another process must act on, such as a command or query, and malicious input that was intended as data, can enter the control plane instead. However, this weakness also applies to more general cases where there are not always control implications.

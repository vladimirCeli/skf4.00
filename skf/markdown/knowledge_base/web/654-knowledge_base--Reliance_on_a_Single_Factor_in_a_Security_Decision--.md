##Description:

A protection mechanism relies exclusively, or to a large extent, on the evaluation of a single condition or the integrity of a single object or entity in order to make a decision about granting access to restricted resources or functionality.



##Mitigation:


PHASE:Architecture and Design:
Use multiple simultaneous checks before granting access to critical operations or granting critical privileges. A weaker but helpful mitigation is to use several successive checks (multiple layers of security).

PHASE:Architecture and Design:
Use redundant access rules on different choke points (e.g., firewalls).

##Description:

The code contains comments that suggest the presence of bugs, incomplete functionality, or weaknesses.

Many suspicious comments, such as BUG, HACK, FIXME, LATER, LATER2, TODO, in the code indicate missing security functionality and checking. Others indicate code problems that programmers should fix, such as hard-coded variables, error handling, not using stored procedures, and performance issues.

##Mitigation:


PHASE:Documentation:
Remove comments that suggest the presence of bugs, incomplete functionality, or weaknesses, before deploying the application.

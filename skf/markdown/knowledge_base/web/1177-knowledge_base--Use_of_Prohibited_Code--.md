##Description:

The software uses a function, library, or third party component that has been explicitly prohibited, whether by the developer or the customer.

The developer - or customers - may wish to restrict or eliminate use of a function, library, or third party component for any number of reasons, including real or suspected vulnerabilities; difficulty to use securely; export controls or license requirements; obsolete or poorly-maintained code; internal code being scheduled for deprecation; etc. To reduce risk of vulnerabilities, the developer might maintain a list of banned functions that programmers must avoid using because the functions are difficult or impossible to use securely. This issue can also make the software more costly and difficult to maintain.

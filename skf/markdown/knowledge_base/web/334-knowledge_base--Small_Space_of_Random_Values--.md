##Description:

The number of possible random values is smaller than needed by the product, making it more susceptible to brute force attacks.



##Mitigation:


PHASE:Architecture and Design Requirements:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:
Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems. Consult FIPS 140-2 Annex C (Approved Random Number Generators).

##Description:

Java packages are not inherently closed; therefore, relying on them for code security is not a good practice.

The purpose of package scope is to prevent accidental access by other parts of a program. This is an ease-of-software-development feature but not a security feature.

##Mitigation:


PHASE:Architecture and Design Implementation:
Data should be private static and final whenever possible. This will assure that your code is protected by instantiating early, preventing access and tampering.

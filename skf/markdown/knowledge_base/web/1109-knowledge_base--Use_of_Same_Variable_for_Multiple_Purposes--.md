The code contains a callable, block, or other code element in which the same variable is used to control more than one unique task or store more than one instance of data.

Use of the same variable for multiple purposes can make it more difficult for a person to read or understand the code, potentially hiding other quality issues. This issue makes it more difficult to maintain the software, which indirectly affects security by making it more difficult or time-consuming to find and/or fix vulnerabilities. It also might make it easier to introduce vulnerabilities.

##Description:

The variable's value is assigned but never used, making it a dead store.

After the assignment, the variable is either assigned another value or goes out of scope. It is likely that the variable is simply vestigial, but it is also possible that the unused variable points out a bug.

##Mitigation:


PHASE:Implementation:
Remove unused variables from the code.

##Description:

A PRNG uses a relatively small space of seeds.



##Mitigation:


PHASE:Architecture and Design:
Use well vetted pseudo-random number generating algorithms with adequate length seeds. Pseudo-random number generators can produce predictable numbers if the generator is known and the seed can be guessed. A 256-bit seed is a good starting point for producing a random enough number.

PHASE:Architecture and Design Requirements:STRATEGY:Libraries or Frameworks:
Use products or modules that conform to FIPS 140-2 [REF-267] to avoid obvious entropy problems. Consult FIPS 140-2 Annex C (Approved Random Number Generators).

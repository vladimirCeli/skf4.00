##Description:

	Password strength meters are intended to motivate users to create stronger passwords in the interest of 
	tightening security. The motivating effect is especially high when showing a score numerically and relative 
	to other users.

##Mitigation:
	
	Verify that a password strength meter/indicator is provided to help users set a stronger secret.

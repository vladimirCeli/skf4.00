# OWASP ZAP passive
-------

## Example:

        The ZAP Baseline scan is a script that is available in the ZAP Docker images.

        It runs the ZAP spider against the specified target for (by default) 1 minute and then waits for 
        the passive scanning to complete before reporting the results.

        This means that the script doesn't perform any actual ‘attacks’ and will run for a relatively 
        short period of time (a few minutes at most).

        By default it reports all alerts as WARNings but you can specify a config file which can change 
        any rules to FAIL or IGNORE.

        This script is intended to be ideal to run in a CI/CD environment, even against production sites.

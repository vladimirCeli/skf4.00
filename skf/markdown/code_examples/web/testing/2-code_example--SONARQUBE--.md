# Sonarqube
-------

## Example:

        SonarQubeÂ® is an automatic code review tool to detect bugs, vulnerabilities, and
        code smells in your code. It can integrate with your existing workflow to 
        enable continuous code inspection across your project branches and pull requests

        Out of the box Sonarqube has a good ruleset but the trick is to write
        your own to automatically govern your ASVS controls.

        There are two ways to extend coding rules:

        - Writing coding rules using Java via a SonarQube plugin
        - Adding XPath rules directly through the SonarQube web interface

# OWASP Dependency track
-------

## Example:

        Dependency-Track is an intelligent Supply Chain Component Analysis platform that allows 
        organizations to identify and reduce risk from the use of third-party and open source components. 
        Dependency-Track takes a unique and highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of 
        Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). This approach provides capabilities that traditional Software
        Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve

        Dependency-Track monitors component usage across all versions of every application in 
        its portfolio in order to proactively identify risk across an organization. 
        The platform has an API-first design and is ideal for use in Continuous Integration 
        (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) environments.
